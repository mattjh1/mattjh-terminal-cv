    - title: gRAG pipeline and RAG application
      color: red
      date: Since 2024
      link: https://github.com/mattjh1/gRAG
      description: |
        gRAG is a multi-faceted project that integrates an advanced ETL pipeline with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. 
        The ETL pipeline processes various text-based file formats, extracts and transforms data using semantic splitting and LLM-based document parsing, and stores it as a knowledge graph in Neo4j. 
        This enables hybrid search capabilities that combine vector embeddings and structured queries for enhanced information retrieval.

        The RAG application utilizes both hybrid and structured retrievers. The hybrid retriever searches vector embeddings for cosine similarity, while the structured retriever extracts entities from queries and executes Neo4j Cypher queries for relevant nodes and relationships, enhancing results for complex RAG tasks.

        Additionally, the project includes a backup and restore feature for Neo4j databases. For demonstration, a pre-built knowledge graph based on Bram Stoker's *Dracula* is included, which can be restored using an automated script or manual commands for quick setup. The database is powered by Langchain's experimental LLMGraphTransformer to generate graph structures from literature.

        The project also features a FastAPI-based interface and integrates with a Chainlit chat application for interactive querying and testing.

    - title: goetl pipeline
      color: red

      description: |
        as a personal project, i developed goetl, a highly performant etl pipeline written in go, designed to extract, transform, and load data for rag (retrieval-augmented generation) solutions.
        the tool specializes in processing data from arbitrary file types using flexible configuration options, and leverages go's goroutines to ensure efficient, concurrent data handling.
        goetl provides core functionality such as chunked text splitting, seamless integration with embedding models, and support for multiple database types including redis and postgresql.
        its configurable and scalable nature makes it adaptable to a wide range of file sources and enables hybrid search capabilities in rag systems.

    - title: Developer Platform for Global Telecom Leader
      color: red
      date: Since 2024
      description: |
